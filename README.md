# Multiple Linear Regression Model in PyTorch

This script showcases my first project in machine learning. Through the use of PyTorch, I am able to build a regression model to model the relationship between predictor variables and a response variable. The algorithm employed to reach the optimized model is full-batch gradient descent.
