# Multiple Linear Regression Model in PyTorch

This script showcases my first project in machine learning. Through the use of PyTorch, I am able to build a regression model to model the relationship between predictor variables and a response variable. The algorithm employed to reach the optimized model is full-batch gradient descent.

The dataset is provided, and an example loss curve is also shown. 

The dataset is from a file called chicago_taxi_train.csv and basically it is a subset of Chicago taxi trips dataset where we have a table outlining numerical information about particular taxi trips such as
the amount of time the trip took as well as the total distance. We consider the attribute of the taxi fares to be the label and the job of our machine learning model is to predict the taxi fares given the
values of intelligently chosen variables.
